### What's this? ðŸ¤”

Supose that you're on a restaurant with some friends and you want to calculate the amount of money by tip percentage that each one has to pay, plus the bill amount. **Tip Calculator** lets you easily do that! 

Input the amount of the bill, then select one of the predefined percentage values for the tip (or input a custom value), then introduce the number of people in your group. That's it!

**You don't have friends?** _Don't worry!_ **Tip Calculator** also has you covered as long as you are not a zero value!
